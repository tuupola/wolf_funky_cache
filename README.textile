h3. Install

Copy files to <i>frog/plugins/funky_cache/</i> folder.

<pre>
cd wolf/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/tuupola/wolf_funky_cache.git funky_cache
</pre>

Open you _config.php_ and make sure the following is set:

<pre>
define('USE_MOD_REWRITE', true);
</pre>

Got to admin and enable Funky Cache plugin.

Reload the admin page to see _"Cache"_ tab appear. Click on the tab to check your settings. 

_Cache file suffix_ is important! It is the suffix of static files written to disk. It should be the same as _URL_SUFFIX_ in wolf config.php.  If your _URL_SUFFIX_ is empty cache file suffix  will default to _.html_.

_Cache folder_ is the folder where static files are written. Folder is related to document root. If you leave this empty cached files will be written to document root. *Webserver must have write access to cache folder.* 

!http://www.appelsiini.net/assets/2008/11/25/funky_settings.png!

Go to shell and create the cache folder and give write access to it.

<pre>
>cd path/to/document/root/
>mkdir cache
>chmod a+w cache
</pre>

Funky Cache depends on correctly setup mod_rewrite rules. Rules are different depending on your Wolf and plugin settings. Click _"Your .htaccess file"_ on sidebar. Cut and paste given code to .htaccess file in your document root.
